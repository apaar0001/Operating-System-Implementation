To Kill (Szeth)
The scene begins with Szeth, 
a Truthless Shin assassin, 
a Truthless Shin assassin, 
a Truthless Shin assassin, 
waiting quietly in a large room, 
watching the Alethi celebrate the signing of a peace treaty with the Parshendi. 
He leaves the room, 
noting that his Parshendi masters will soon withdraw. 
Szeth wears white under the orders of the Parshendi to follow their traditions so that King Gavilar could see him coming.
When he reaches the area just outside the King's quarters, 
Szeth uses his abilities as a Surgebinder to fight his way past the guards. 
As he reaches the king's quarters,
he is confronted by a Shardbearer as the King flees.
Szeth fights his way past the Shardbearer, 
but soon realizes that the Shardbearer, 
not the man he is chasing, is King Gavilar. 
He returns and fights him, 
eventually defeating him by causing the balcony he is standing on to collapse and kill Gavilar. 
Szeth is nearly killed in the fight.
As Gavilar dies, 
he asks Szeth who sent him, 
suspecting the Ghostbloods or one of his highprinces. 
When Szeth tells Gavilar the Parshendi sent him, 
Gavilar is confused and says, "The Parshendi? 
That makes no sense."
